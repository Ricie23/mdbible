## Chapter 1
#Philem_1

##### #Philem_1_1. 
 Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker
##### #Philem_1_2. 
 and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house :
##### #Philem_1_3. 
 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
##### #Philem_1_4. 
 I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,
##### #Philem_1_5. 
 because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints,
##### #Philem_1_6. 
 and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.
##### #Philem_1_7. 
 For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.
##### #Philem_1_8. 
 Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,
##### #Philem_1_9. 
 yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you — I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus —
##### #Philem_1_10. 
 I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment.
##### #Philem_1_11. 
 ( Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me .)
##### #Philem_1_12. 
 I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.
##### #Philem_1_13. 
 I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel,
##### #Philem_1_14. 
 but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord.
##### #Philem_1_15. 
 For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,
##### #Philem_1_16. 
 no longer as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother — especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
##### #Philem_1_17. 
 So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me.
##### #Philem_1_18. 
 If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
##### #Philem_1_19. 
 I, Paul, write this with my own hand : I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.
##### #Philem_1_20. 
 Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
##### #Philem_1_21. 
 Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
##### #Philem_1_22. 
 At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.
##### #Philem_1_23. 
 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,
##### #Philem_1_24. 
 and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
##### #Philem_1_25. 
 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
